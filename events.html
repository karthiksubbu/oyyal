                                    <span class="event-date">8 October 2019</span>
                                    <span class="event-description">We are very pleased to state that Oyyal foundation has started its 22nd and 23rd SEED Points in RamanDoddi and ChinnaGuththi villages which are located in Krishnagiri District of Tamilnadu. As we learnt from our previous field visit to these villages, though government is doing its part by providing free education and financial assistance, the tribal population that inhabits these places are in dire need of our social assistance. </span>
                                    <span class="event-description">Hence we decided to take lay the cornerstone for transformation of these villages by starting our SEED points (Student Education and Extra Curricular skill Development Point) in each of these villages. OYYAL is determined to contribute in every way it can and this step is just the beginning of many more to come. </span>

                                    <span class="event-date">30 September 2019</span>
                                    <span class="event-description">In the pursuit of its mission of socio economic development in Rural areas , OYYAL has always been enthusiastic to explore new horizons. One such effort was to conduct field visits to villages where OYYAL still has not got foothold. The purpose of the field visit is to interact with the villagers, understand their needs , grievances and get an overall idea on where OYYAL can contribute. For the Field visit, we chose the villages of RamanDoddi and ChinnaGuththi. This  particular visit was unique because both these villages had their majority of population belonging to tribal community. </span>
                                    <span class="event-description">After a detailed interaction, it was evident that lack of education, seasonal unemployment, Lack of proper physical, human and social infrastructure is pushing these villages into oblivion. It is amazing that women are playing an active and dominant role in both bread-winning and societal development. Both RamanDoddi and ChinnaGuththi, which are situated in the backwoods of Krishnagiri district need empowerment through the education. Hence we decided to make both these villages as areas of work under OYYAL family and do our best for their upliftment. </span>

                                    <span class="event-date">26 January 2019</span>
                                    <span class="event-description">OYYAL has always championed taking up the issues of underprivileged, with special focus on vulnerable sections. Children, the most vulnerable section of the society, especially from a  marginal sect  like Irula community of Vallinagar village, need our focused efforts more than anybody else. OYYAL believes that the first step to empowerment of the children and parents, is by bringing awareness about issues like Child Abuse, Child Labor, Child Marriage and legislations enacted for protection of children from societal evils. For this purpose OYYAL conducted "Awareness Campaign on Child Protection" on 26th January in the Vallinagar village.</span>
                                    <span class="event-description">This program was presided enthusiastically by by Mr.Subash Bose, the District Child Protection Officer (DCPO) of Krishnagiri district. The event was not only informative but also thought provoking. We express our sincere gratitude to Mr.Subash for his compassionate, patient and exuberant work ethics. It was a remarkable event as OYYAL was able to effectively contribute for child welfare with a touch of good governance. </span>

                                    <span class="event-description">OYYAL has always looked forward to contribute for the socio-economic progress of the village as a whole. For this it's essential to understand the persisting problems and get a perspective from ground level. This Republic Day we got a chance to attend the GramaSabha of Chinnakothur village. GramaSabha, which is the formal platform for discussion of the issues in the village and debating the solutions pondered, proved to be a perfect channel for us to learn and participate in the bigger picture.</span>
                                    <span class="event-description">This interaction also had the presence of  several Government Officials like Block Development Officer, District Child Protection Officer, Block Resource Teacher and others which helped us in getting a bureaucratic perspective. The Women of this village amazed us by demonstrating their knowledge of the Governance, Resolutions, etc., despite being mostly illiterate. Their remarkable resilience strengthened our resolve to work harder for a better society. </span>

                                    <span class="event-description">During the OYYAL'S recent visit to the newly established SEED Point in ValliNagar village, It was noticed that there is a decline in the School attendance of the ValliNagar's kids who attend the Neralagiri school. On further enquiring, we came to know the real reason behind this is lack of proper clothing for the kids to attend school with dignity.</span>
                                    <span class="event-description">To restore the joy of returning to school for these kids, OYYAL decided to donate a new set of School Uniforms to all the kids who are the verge of dropping out of school. The expenditure of 14,000 rupees which OYYAL had incurred for this purpose, had a definite and satisfactory outcome as there was an immediate and sustained increase in the school attendance. Thus OYYAL takes a step forward in its journey of Societal Uplifting  through rural education. </span>

                                    <span class="event-description">The efforts of OYYAL to make a change are usually targeted to contribute for the all round development of students belonging from IV to VIII standards. However, we have also tried to interact with the younger minds by engaging them in cultural activities. However, this time OYYAL has made an exclusive effort to engage the kids of lower primary classes by story telling. "Kathai Solli" Sathish, a prominent story teller from Chennai, has benevolently accepted our request to spearhead the event.</span>
                                    <span class="event-description">Dressing himself as a clown, he enacted each story with vigor and conveyed its essence in a wonderful way making the event a huge success.

These villages are marked with grave socio-economic, issues ranging from poverty, illiteracy to social deprivation as result of being from backward classes. All these villages have single-teacher-school, and hence the chances of getting a wholesome education for students is very bleak.</span>
                                    <span class="event-description">Therefore, we believe that our SEED points in these villages will make a difference certainly.</span>

                                    <span class="event-description">"Stories are the currency of human contact" - Robert McKee.One of the most important objectives of OYYAL is to improve the basic language and communication skills of the kids. We have earlier employed a lot of activities like elocution, essay writing to promote communication skills among the children. This time we have decided to explore the horizon of storytelling which proved to be magnificent. The participants were children from age groups belonging to IV to VIII standard, who were provided with a Tamil story book each. The kids were expected to narrate a story and were free to add or delete anything from the content- the only condition was No mugging. The kids proved themselves to exceptionally well at the craft of storytelling. Given the fact that about 90 % of the kids were from non-Tamil speaking background, their performance could only be called stupendous. Be it any part of their act - language, diction, gestures, the kids aced it with ease. At the end of the program the kids were rewarded with a book each.</span>

                                    <span class="event-description">Oyyal has yet again contributed for the development of infrastructure of underprivileged schools by sponsoring book shelves to the school library of Puliyarasi village, near Shoolagiri. The initial plan was to contribute to library setup by purchasing books. However, we came to know that there is no dearth of books in the school, due to books being donated by the government.</span>
                                    <span class="event-description">Hence, we have assisted in setting up of the library by purchasing the library racks so as to ensure smooth distribution and maintenance of books.

The village lacking basic facilities including the roads (4km walk) from the plains to the village, makes them deprived of quality education, jobs and a stable livelihood. People are still in an age of using donkeys to transport the food and other basic amenities from the nearest village to their village. </span>

Steps are taken from Oyyal side to share this issue to media to get government attention and create an impact. We also talked with local villagers to see if we can setup our SEED point in this village. Once we get a reasonable support from the localities, we can do our part to start working in this village also. </span>

A total of 157 students from Azhagapuram, KariyaSandram, Kuriyanapalli and GangojiKotthur participated in the event in which they competed in several categories of elocution, Drawing, Essay Writing, Slogans and Skits. The students performed exceedingly well in all of them. A category that deserves a special mention here is the "Projects on Nature Conservation and Resource Management". In this each SEED Point centre was given a topic like Water Management, Plastic Recycling, Eradication of Seemai Karuvelam etc.</span>
                                    <span class="event-description">on which the projects are to be based upon.

The event also hosted a lunch for the participants which turned out to be the most joyful experience for Oyyal volunteers. We express our sincere appreciation and gratitude to all the SEED point tutors for their diligent efforts. We also thank the visitors for the event Theventhiran, Aravind Matta, Karthik and RajKumar who also acted as members of the panel to evaluate the performances of the Students.</span>

                                    <span class="event-description">OYYAL steps forward to assist chandran, a final year Mechanical engineering student from Kalingavaram village, Krishnagiri district. </span>
                                    <span class="event-description">Though we have known Chandran from 2014, as a tutor for our SEED program, we were not aware of his indigent financial conditions. Recently when we were looking for the candidates who require OYYAL’s financial assistance so as to finish their education, we came to know that destitution is forcing Chandran to drop out of the college as he was unable to pay the final year fee. Moved by his plight, OYYAL committed itself to assist him to continue his studies. OYYAL’s contribution of 9000/- along with the benevolent aid of 11000/- given by another group called “Spreading smiles” sufficed to pay the entire final year fee, enabling Chandran to continue his education.
	                                We extend our special thanks to Swaminathan Krishnamurthy for acting as a bridge between OYYAL and SPREADING SMILES. Also we are grateful for all the painstaking efforts put in by our volunteer Mr.Nagaraju which helped us a great deal. May all our collective efforts lead to fruition.</span>
