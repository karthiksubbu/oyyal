                                    <div>In the year 2012, when we were doing a program in a village called Chinnakothur near Shoolagiri of Krishnagiri district, we came to know that they did not have English teacher for their whole academic year and because of that number of failures were more. As we were doing that program just before their annual examination we could not help them in placing a teacher for English. Then we from OYYAL decided to find the root cause of this issue and found that there are many issues from top level [Government] till the bottom level [Parents]. But it takes time to solve all these issues and to fill the vacancies. By that time the failures among students will be increasing year by year. These failures increase the drop outs of 10th students for the subsequent years. On the other hand, some parents will choose to leave this school, for a better school. This would reduce the school strength and slowly the school itself might be closed by the government, which results in loss of education, at their neighborhood, for less privileged children. So we chose to take up the responsibility of placing appropriate teachers, who are graduates from local villages. We utilize the services of our local coordinator to find those graduates. The appointment is done for one full academic year to educate the students in the corresponding subjects. Finally we appointed Ms.Bhuvana, as a teacher for English.</div>
                                    <div>In Theertham Government school, many students failed due to unavailability of social sciences teacher. Oyyal took the initiative to appoint Mr.Shankaran as the Social Sciences teacher for the academic years 2013-2014, and also for 2014-2015</div>
                                    <div>In Chinnakothur, Maths teacher got transferred to other school, in the middle of 2013-2014 academic year. For the academic year 2014-2015, Oyyal appointed a Maths teacher, Ms.Sivaranjani for the benefit of students.

                                    <div style="margin-bottom:10px;">For the academic year 2014-2015, we received a request from Government school, Nalloor in Krishnagiri district. Those school students do not have proper language writing skills, because of lack of teacher for their subjects. Village president and Headmaster requested help from Oyyal. Oyyal is looking for a good teacher in fulfilling this need.</div>
                                    
                                    <div><h4 class="sub-title">A Class room renovation and a Toilet set up</h4></div>
                					<div>In chinnakothur Government school, where we work, out of the 4 class rooms they have, one room was not usable due to the pathetic condition of roofs, which in turn led way to the snakes and other poisonous insects inside the class. So, students had to sit outside the class for studying. We decided to renovate this class room and accomplished it in July 2014. This school also lacked the toilet facility. This made life extremely difficult for the girl students and the staffs too. We have fixed this problem also in July 2014.</div>
